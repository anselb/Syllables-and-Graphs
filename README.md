# Graph Project
This project will examine common English syllables and how they lead into one another in a graph.
This project will use a list of syllables from this [resource](http://www.fldoe.org/core/fileparse.php/7539/urlt/manual.pdf) (starting on page 34).
I plan to find a list of syllabicated, or use a program to turn a list of words in syllables.
This [reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/8qxpqd/20180613_challenge_363_intermediate_word/) has some solutions for a word hyphenator using a popular algorithm.
In the worst case scenario, I would not look at words by their syllables, but rather just search for 3+ length syllables in the words' spellings.

## Things to examine using graph of English syllables:
- Longest chain of syllables
- Most important syllable in English language (PageRank Algorithm)
- A possible indicator of the difficulty of learning the English language (Average path length and the diameter of a graph). The average path and diameter might suggest something about the distribution of syllables among all words.
